Contributing to <Veson Repo> 
############################

We welcome contributions to this codebase, whether that's pull requests to improve our code
or opening Github Issues to describe problems you're having.

Contributing Code: CLA
=======================

Before Veson Nautical can accept any code contributions from you, you'll need to sign the
`contributor license agreement`_ and send it in. This confirms that you have the authority 
to contribute the code in the pull request and ensures that Veson Nautical can relicense it.  

You should print out the agreement and sign it. Then scan (or photograph) the signed agreement 
and email it to the email address indicated on the agreement. Alternatively, you're also free 
to physically mail the agreement to the street address on the agreement. Once we have your 
agreement in hand, we can begin reviewing and merging your work.

Expectations You Have of Us
===========================

When making a pull request, expect a response from someone on the Veson team within two weeks.

Expectations We Have of You
===========================

Basic coding principles apply: Use unit or integration testing where possible, and if a CI/CD
pipeline is present, make sure your changes pass automation.

We may ask you to make changes to your code, or reject the feature outright. To avoid that,
get in touch with us by opening a Github Issue describing the defect or feature you'd like to
address, and engage with us before you start building code. 

If you don't respond to our feedback within two weeks, we reserve the right to close your 
pull request. You may reopen it when you are ready to engage again.
